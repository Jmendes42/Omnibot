# Omnibot v1

This project is a deep dive into the entire process of robotic development from scratch. The primary goal is to create an autonomous firefighter car capable of collaborating with other equipment and personnel. Upon completion, the base will be used for other mobile projects.
For now, the project is still in the design and model development phase.
The model can be found at [Omnibot](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a2723514850fd7244817eeb4/w/c662be5207a4c3a24a2eff45/e/c64fa924200e138f2d790778?renderMode=0&uiState=66c0054bb8966e62934eeb2c)
